    <p>Baobab is an experimental platform where the process and the tryouts of photography students are highlighted and re-considered. 

In this process the team members are facilitating, exhibitions, publications, lectures and manifestations of all kinds. The goal of the Baobab platform is to push the student to take authority of their own artistic, photographic and professional career. We try to create ‘hands on’ experiences with which these participants can take into the next step of their photographic development. In order for them to take their own decisions, and to form a base for a more entrepreneurial spirit within the photographic world. 
Baobab has been producing an annual magazine, a sort of cook book where many different ingredients end up creating each time a new recipe. 

Through the collaboration with different graphic designers and student guest editors, Baobab creates opportunities where new narratives can be explored.

Three guest-editors are chosen to decide upon the content, form and picture-edit of the magazine. Together with a Graphic Designer they are in full control over all these decisions. Not only the challenge the construction of a magazine, but also to challenge the idea of what a magazine is. Consequently every issue of Baobab magazine will be different because of this way of working with guest editors.
