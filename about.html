    <p>Baobab is an experimental platform made for photography students to challenge the future of the medium.<br><br>
The goal of the Baobab platform is to push the student to take authority of its own photographic and professional career. We create hands on experiences to be taken into the next step of one’s photographic development.<br><br>
The photography world is changing and so are the photographers, we as Baobab want to be a sandbox where to play with new ideas to partake in the photographic landscape. By improving its entrepreneurial capacity we want the photographer to find a new public outside of the comfort zone of the already established photo-world.<br><br>
So we’ve decided to create a magazine, a sort of cook book where many different ingredients end up creating each time a new recipe. <br><br>
Parallel to the publication of an annual magazine, we facilitate interventions, exhibitions, lectures where these works can find new ways of expression but most importantly, new audiences.<br><br>
<i>Magazine</i> <br>The production of the magazine is based on a collaboration between three student-guest editors and a graphic designer. This team decides upon the content of the publication, its message and consequently selects a collection of works to be edited in a completely new narrative.<br><br>
Every issue a new group of editors foster their idea of what a magazine should be. Every issue of Baobab magazine will be different.
